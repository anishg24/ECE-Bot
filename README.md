# ECE Bot*
*Proper Name TBD

**This repo still under construction, pardon our stardust!**

## Purpose:
To centralize discord servers for classes so that students don't have to
scramble around the internet to find a big empty server with 2 channels
that are frequently used.

## Goals:
This bot should be able to:

- [x] Create a category and several channels for each course
- [ ] Do the above automatically
- [ ] Communicate with users to automatically assign roles
- [ ] Assign a "class leader" who can control aspects of their class' channels
- [ ] Provide a unique class wiki that stores important links (like Canvas page, Syllabus, etc.)
- [ ] Automatically convert homework questions to threads
- [ ] Be generic enough to easily deploy to any department (like CSE or MATH)

And more, tbd!

## Contributing:

I'm not looking for many contributors at the moment, as I'm still trying
to figure out the end goal really is. That being said, if you're interested
about contributing and aiding me in this idea, then feel free
to reach out at my Discord: `FlowedTensor#6720`.
